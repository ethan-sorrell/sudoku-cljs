# sudoku-cljs

A [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) application that acts as an interactive sudoku solver. Try it [here.](https://ethan-sorrell.github.io/sudoku-cljs/)

## Progress:
I learned a lot from this project, but it's mostly abandoned.

## Run application:

```
lein clean
lein dev
```

shadow-cljs will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:8280](http://localhost:8280).
