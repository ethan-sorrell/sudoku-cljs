# sudoku-cljs

A [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) application that acts as an interactive sudoku solver.
After more experience with lisps (mostly racket), a lot of the code is a bit verbose. It's certainly not idiomatic clojure for that matter.

## Development Mode

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein dev
```

shadow-cljs will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:8280](http://localhost:8280).
