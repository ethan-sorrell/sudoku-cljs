- Where do we want to check for valid input?
- *TODO* resolve terminology
  - change instances of "matrix" to "board" in game.cljs

- *FIXME* when there is an error on board, creating error css, our flexbox columns are messed up somehow

- *FIXME* some of the terminology seems wrong in view helper function: table-row takes a col parameter, should be row?

- re-write table-row using output-row format


* output table thoughts:
- have a css class for cells which are restricted by input
- ? have a css class for cells which we can determine by ruleset
- ? have control panel to decide which propagation rules we will apply
- ? ability to hover restricted numbers to see which propagation rule determined restriction
- *BIG QUESTION*:
  - Do we want to completely recalculate output table on each update
    - or, is it possible + more efficient to mutate state
    - or can we somehow memoize?
